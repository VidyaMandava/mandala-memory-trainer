# 🧠 Mandala Memory Trainer

An interactive educational web application designed to enhance visual memory skills through beautiful, symmetric mandala patterns. Perfect for children, educators, and anyone looking to improve their memory and concentration abilities.

## 🎯 Features

### 🎨 Dynamic Pattern Generation
- **Algorithmic mandala creation** using seeded random generation
- **Three difficulty levels** with increasing complexity:
  - **Beginner**: Simple 2-3 element patterns (circles, squares, triangles)
  - **Intermediate**: Medium complexity with 4-5 elements
  - **Advanced**: Complex multi-layered patterns with overlapping petals and geometric designs
- **Unique designs** generated on demand with deterministic seeds for reproducibility

### ⏱️ Configurable Memory Training
- **Adjustable exposure times**: 2 seconds to 60 seconds
- **Progressive difficulty**: Start simple and advance to complex patterns
- **Round-based gameplay**: 10 rounds per session
- **Physical coloring support**: Designed for use with crayons and colored pencils

### 🎮 User-Friendly Interface
- **Clean, kid-friendly design** with intuitive controls
- **Responsive layout** that works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time countdown timer** during pattern display
- **Side-by-side comparison** of original and outline versions

### 🖨️ Educational Integration
- **Print-ready outline generation** for offline coloring activities
- **Teacher-friendly settings** for classroom use
- **No digital coloring required** - encourages hands-on creative activity
- **Memory training methodology** based on visual pattern recognition

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

```typescript
// Seeded random generation for reproducible patterns
class SeededRandom {
  // Ensures same seed produces same pattern
}

// Advanced pattern generation with multiple algorithms
class MandalaGenerator {
  // Creates complex geometric patterns based on difficulty
  - generatePetalFlower()      // Overlapping elliptical petals
  - generateComplexStar()      // Multi-colored star points  
  - generateLayeredMandala()   // Concentric pattern layers
  - generateGeometricFlower()  // Diamond-shaped petals
}
```

### Key Features Implementation
- **SVG-based rendering** for crisp, scalable graphics
- **Deterministic pattern generation** using mathematical algorithms
- **Responsive timer system** with smooth countdown animations
- **State management** for game progression and settings
